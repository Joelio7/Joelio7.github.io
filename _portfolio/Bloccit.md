## Explanation

This was the first application on my web development journey. It was part of the foundational requirement that my coding bootcamp used to teach me Ruby on Rails. It's an ROR replica of the popular website Reddit.

## Problem

Since Bloccit was my first project, understanding the MVC framework pattern and becoming better at Ruby was the biggest problem I encountered. As a brand new programmer, I spent a lot of my time learning and digesting new concepts.

## Solution

After a couple months of countless hours at my computer practicing Ruby problems,reading blogs written by Rails fanatics, and of course... coding. I finally made my final push to Github.

## Results

Completing this project was possibly the most profound moment in my programming journey. It gave me the confidence that if I could finish Bloccit, I could complete any project and smash through future road blocks.
