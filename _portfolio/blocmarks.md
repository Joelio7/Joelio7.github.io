## Explanation

A Ruby on Rails application that allows users to share and save bookmarks. It was fun building an app that closely relates to something I do almost daily.

## Problem

  Finding an efficient way to authenticate and manage user sessions was the main issue I encountered building Blocmarks. I wanted each user to have a specific profile page where they could store their saved bookmarks as well as manage the ones they created.

## Solution

Discovering the Devise gem was very beneficial to me. Devise simplified creating and managing user sessions. This saved a lot of time and minimized the room for error I would have dealt with building user sessions from scratch.

## Conclusion

Building Blocmarks taught me how to create a useful web app that has the same functionality as applications I use regularly. I also got an opportunity to do some work with Bootstrap, a Javascript framework that helps decrease the time it takes to build the front end side of an application. Despite running into difficulty with user sessions, got the job done and I added another useful too to the belt.
