## Explanation

Bloc Jams immersed me into the Front End side of web development. The project strengthened my knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and JQuery.

## Problem

 During this project, I was having issues organizing my javascript code in a manor that was clean and readable. I found my javascript files getting large and hard to debug. I was also facing challenges making my project render properly on a smart phone screen.

## Solution

Converting a lot of vanilla javascript to JQuery made my project a lot more manageable. JQuery required less code and greatly reduced the room for error. I read about best practices on making websites mobile responsive. Chrome has a nice feature that shows what my project will look like based on screen size. I was able to modify the player bar when the screen size was reduced allowing a nice user experience on different devices.

## Conclusion

Bloc Jams challenged my Front End abilities in new ways,improving my knowledge of javascript and website responsiveness. It was one of my most fulfilling projects to complete. I really admire the intuitiveness of music player apps such as Spotify or Itunes. This gave me a glimpse on these technologies work.
