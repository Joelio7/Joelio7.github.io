## Explanation

Bloc Jams Angular is a single page application or ("SPA"). "Bloc Jams Angular" differs from Bloc Jams because it relies on loading different states of one page rather than containing multiple pages like the original.

## Problem

 Learning the AngularJS and the principles of a SPA application was a new experience for me. Understand Angular's best practices was a learning curve.

## Solution

Rebuilding Bloc Jams in Angular was a great approach to learning the framework. Being able to compare the differences in the way the two apps are built helped me build a foundational understanding of AngularJS, and what makes it stand out as a popular Front End framework.

## Conclusion

Bloc Jams Angular was a fun project that introduced me to the world of AngularJS. I learned how powerful of a tool Angular can be and where it fits among javascript's other Front End frameworks.
