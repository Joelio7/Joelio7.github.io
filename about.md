### Background

I am an aspiring Web Developer from the Seattle area. After graduating with a Communications degree,I decided I wanted a craft I could call my own. A few developers introduced me to programming While I was working in customer service at a tech startup.After completing a few courses from Code Academy, I fell in love and knew it was time for me to take the next step.


Since I had just graduated and was working full time, going back to  college for a CS degree would not be possible. A friend of mine told me about Bloc, a coding bootcamp that allows you to choose your learning pace. I enrolled in Bloc's full stack web development bootcamp in July, 2015 and completed it in May, 2016. Since then I have been working part time at a startup called MediaRails that focuses on CRM to track business influencers for companies.

### Summary

I love learning new web languages and frameworks but I specialize in Ruby on Rails and Front End development. I am always looking for new projects and ways I can stretch my abilities as a developer. Coding good quality applications that are readable and maintainable is important to me. If I'm not coding, I am probably playing basketball or spending time with family and friends.
